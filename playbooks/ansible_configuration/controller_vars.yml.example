# AAP Controller Configuration Variables

# Keep controller_vars.yml out of version control (contains credentials)

# ========================================
# Controller Connection
# ========================================
controller_host: "https://ansible.prod.spg"

# Authentication Method 1: OAuth Token (recommended)
# Generate token in AAP UI: Administration > Users > <your user> > Tokens
controller_oauthtoken: ""

# Authentication Method 2: Username/Password (fallback)
controller_username: ""
controller_password: ""

# Certificate verification (set to false for self-signed certs)
controller_verify_ssl: false

# ========================================
# Organization and Project
# ========================================
organization_name: "Default"

# Notes
# ========================================
# 1. OAuth tokens are more secure than username/password
# 2. Generate token with 'Write' scope for job template creation
# 3. Set controller_verify_ssl: false only in lab environments
# 4. Keep this file permissions: chmod 600 controller_vars.yml
# 5. Add to .gitignore to prevent credential leakage
